# Web_Scraper-
A simple and efficient Python-based web scraper that dynamically fetches and analyzes content from any user-provided URL. The tool extracts key information, including the website's title, meta description, tag counts (&lt;h1>, &lt;h2>, &lt;p>), and headlines. It also retrieves the website's IP address and handles errors gracefully.
